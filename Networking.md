**Appemdix B: Life of a Packet**

- Remark1: Source and Destination MAC addresses of a packet are updated hop by hop. The source and destination IP addresses always remain unchanged end to end.

- Remark2: DNS resolves FQDN (fully qualified domain names) to IP addresses. DNS cache is a local storage of DNS records (stores IP addresses of previously visited FQDNs). ARP cache entries are created when an IP address is resolved to a MAC address.

- Remark 3: If the destination IP address is not within the local subnet, the packet will be forwarded to its default gateway by setting the destination MAC address to the default gateway's MAC address.
